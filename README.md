COVID Data Exploration Project
This repository contains documentation and code related to my COVID data exploration project, where I used SQL to analyze COVID deaths and vaccinations data. By examining data from multiple Excel files, I uncovered key insights that shed light on the pandemic's impact on different populations and regions.

Key Findings
One of the most significant findings of the project was the strong correlation between vaccination rates and lower COVID-19 mortality rates. By analyzing vaccination rates and new deaths/cases data for each continent on a specific date, I was able to gain a better understanding of the pandemic's impact on different populations and regions.

Getting Started
To explore the project, simply clone the repository and review the code and documentation provided. The code is written in SQL and can be executed on any SQL platform.
